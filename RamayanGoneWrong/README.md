# Ramayan, Gone Wrong

### About This Work


[Ramayan, Gone Wrong](RamayanGoneWrong.md) is a novella recasting the *Ramayana* where Ram weds Supranakha. This Ramayan does not include Sita. Ram, the ideal man, is bound not to Sita’s devotion, but to Supranakha’s cunning. Without Sita, the 'maryada' becomes a liability, not strength. It is a tale of honor and deceit.

- **The Wrong Bride**: Unscarred by Lakshman’s blade, Supranakha tricks Ram into marriage — her schemes as sharp as knives against his solemn duty.
- **Virtue’s Trial**: Ram faces no Ravana, but a wife whose whispered plots twist his iron principles into shackles.
- **A World Unmade**: In Ayodhya, love curdles into betrayal, and trust becomes the sharpest weapon.
