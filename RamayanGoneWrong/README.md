# Ramayan, Gone Wrong

### About This Work


[Ramayan, Gone Wrong](RamayanGoneWrong.md) is a novella recasting the *Ramayana* where Ram, the ideal man, meets Supranakha, his cunning wife. This Ramayan does not include Sita. Explore how, without Sita, the 'maryada' of Ram becomes a liability, not strength. It is a tale of honor and deceit.

- **The Wrong Bride**: Supranakha, unscarred by Lakshman’s blade, tricks Ram into marriage, her schemes sharp as knives against his solemn duty.
- **Virtue’s Trial**: Ram, pure and steadfast, faces no warrior like Ravana, but a woman whose quiet plots bend his iron principles.
- **A World Unmade**: Ayodhya falls to betrayal’s slow poison, where love and trust twist into a fight for Ram’s name, grim and uncertain.
