# Ramayan, Gone Wrong

*A Novella*  


# Chapter 1: The Unlikely Union

## The Courtyard

Dust hung thick in the air, settling on cracked stone and faded marigolds. Ram sat beneath the neem tree, its roots twisting like old scars through the earth. Luv swung a wooden sword, striking at shadows that fled before him.

Surpanakha’s footsteps were soft but certain as she approached, carrying a small basket wrapped in cloth. Ram looked up, hope flickering in his eyes.

He held out a pomegranate, its red seeds gleaming like scattered rubies. “Even thorns bear fruit,” he said gently.

She took the fruit but did not break it open. Her fingers curled around it, cold and still. “Thorns protect their fruit,” she said, voice low and smooth. “Men pluck it without care.”

Ram’s gaze softened as he watched Luv swing his sword at the fading light. “He has your fire,” Ram said.

Surpanakha turned away, her smile thin. “And your family’s tongue. Bharath told him kings don’t play with toys.”

Ram’s chest tightened. Bharath had given the sword himself, a gift meant to bind the boy to his uncles.

## The Jewelry Chest

Kausalya’s hands shook as she pried open the chest. The lid groaned. Inside, a ruby choker lay half-buried under dust—its stones glinting like dried blood.

Surpanakha’s eyes flickered to a ruby choker, its stones catching the lamplight like drops of blood.

“You honor me too much,” Surpanakha said softly.

Kausalya clasped the choker around her neck. The metal pressed warm against her skin. “This house is yours now.”

Surpanakha smiled, but it did not reach her eyes. She traced the ruby’s edge. A mother’s love is easy to fool, she thought.

Kausalya’s breath hitched. She pressed a bracelet into Surpanakha’s palm. “For Luv’s bride.”

Surpanakha’s thumb brushed the cold metal. A pawn’s ransom, she thought.


## Raavani household

Far from Ayodhya, in the shadowed halls, mother of Surpanakha, Raavani sat like a queen on a throne of silence. She looked at her ring,a gift from her mother. 

Kaikesi, her eldest, stood nearby, her face pale and drawn. The portrait of her late husband hung crooked on the wall, a silent witness to a life ended too soon. His heart had failed him. 

Her younger daughters, Kumbhini and Tadaka, moved around her like restless shadows, their eyes sharp and calculating.

Raavani’s voice was low but firm. “This house is your first love,” she said, her fingers tightening on the armrest. “No man will claim you while I breathe.” "My daughter Supranakha has fotgotten us"

Kumbhini smiled, slow, deliberate. “They say Ayodhya is weak. That Ram is soft.”

Kaikesi’s gaze sharpened. “Softness is a lie. Strength is control.”

The daughters exchanged glances, their unspoken plans weaving like threads in the dark.


## At the bank of Sarayu River

Back in Ayodhya,Sarayu ran thick with mud. Ram knelt and scrubbed his hands in the cold water. The silt stung his nails.

Behind him, Lakshman drew his bow. The string creaked.

“Surpanakha is spreading lies,” Lakshman said. “Says Ram trusts her family. Says the brothers are at each other’s throats.”

Ram looked up. “You are my life.” He paused. “More than my own.” Lakshman did not answer. He knew.

“Time heals,” Ram said. “Only trust and love can fix a broken soul.”

"Not poison." Lakshman loosed the arrow. It vanished in the swirling water. "You're too trusting."

Ram watched the river swallow the shaft. "And you not enough."



## The Empty House

The evening meal was quiet. Kausalya sat apart, watching Surpanakha with a mix of hope and doubt.

Bharath and Lakshman ate in silence. Their plates held the same food, but Surpanakha poured spiced buttermilk for Ram and water for the others.

Shanta traced circles in her rice. Her face was unreadable.

Later, in the dim room, Surpanakha spoke softly to Ram.

“Your mother wonders if you’ve lost your way. Says you don’t see.”

Ram’s hands rested on his knees. “Truth is quiet. It hides beneath noise.”

She leaned close. Her breath smelled of jasmine and something sharp.

“Your brothers think you weak. Lakshman doesn't respect you. Bharath is eyeing the crown.”

Ram’s eyes met hers, searching. “I listen to my heart.”

Behind the closed door, the palace murmured with secrets. Whispers of doubt, scandal, a king who had chosen the wrong bride.



## The Coughing

Blood stained Kausalya’s handkerchief—dark, like crushed hibiscus petals pressed between old pages. Her breath came ragged, each cough a slow unraveling, as if the cells inside her were turning to dust, breaking down quietly, unseen.

She sat by the window, pale light falling on her skin that seemed thinner each day, as if the sickness was eating her from the inside out. 

Ram watched, helpless, feeling the weight of something breaking in the air between them.

Her fingers found his cheek, cold and trembling. Her eyes held a quiet sorrow, deep and endless.

She whispered, voice cracked like dry earth, “You walk a blade’s edge — duty to wife, duty to blood, duty to justice. Cling to one, the others burn you.” Her eyes held him. “ And beware, my son, lies twist even strong minds. Truth is your shield. It breaks easy.”

Ram’s heart clenched. Somewhere inside, a part of him was rotting too—his old ideals, the sharp edges of his conscience dulling like forgotten bones buried beneath the soil. He wanted to fight, to hold on, but the decay was slow and patient, creeping through his spirit like a shadow.

By dusk, the servants whispered in hushed tones. The queen’s sickness was no secret now. It was a slow rot, a shadow growing in the house—and in Ram’s heart.

# Chapter 2: The Fractured Bonds

## The Gift

Bharath placed the dagger on the table. Pearl handle, like Ram’s crown.

"For your tenth year," Bharath said.

Luv looked at his mother.

Surpanakha smiled. "How thoughtful."

Ram exhaled. Shoulders easing. Maybe time could mend this.

Later, under the neem tree, she buried it.

"Gifts are debts," she told Luv. "He’ll collect."

Ram saw the turned earth at dawn. Touched it. Walked away.

By dusk, Luv carried a different knife —one Surpanakha'sister had given him. Its edge was sharper than a boy needed.

Whispers had begun. Bharath’s gift was cold. His care, questioned.


## The Web of Rumors

In the dim light of Raavani’s chamber, Surpanakha sat with Kumbhini and Tadaka. The air was thick with the scent of crushed berries and whispered schemes.

Surpanakha crushed a blackberry between her fingers. The juice seeped into her skin like old blood, dark and staining. “The court believes in shadows,” she said, voice low and sharp. “Let them believe Ram’s heart belongs to us now”

Kumbhini’s eyes gleamed in the flickering candlelight. “That he found solace only with us. That Bharath’s loyalty is brittle, Lakshman’s pride fragile, and Shanta’s silence a wound waiting to bleed.”

Tadaka smiled, cold and cruel. “The kingdom will believe what they want to hear. A fractured family is easier to break.”

Surpanakha leaned forward, her voice a whisper but heavy with promise. “We must feed the fire carefully. The more they believe the lie, the easier it will be to claim what is ours.”

The three women exchanged glances, their unspoken plans weaving like threads in the dark.

The past was never far. It lingered in shadows, shaping the present with silent hands.


## Shadows of the Past

The firelight flickered against cold stone walls. A young Surpanakha sat cross-legged, eyes wide but hardening. 

Raavani’s voice cut through the silence, smooth and sharp as a blade.

“Win by any means,” she said, her breath a whisper of steel. “Mercy is a weakness. Power is the only truth.”

She leaned closer, her shadow falling over Surpanakha. “Swords are for men who cannot think. A woman’s weapon is her mind. Words cut deeper than steel, and lies last longer than wounds. Let the men play with their arrows. We will shape the world with whispers.”

Surpanakha nodded, the lesson burning into her like a brand. The world was a battlefield, and she would learn to fight with every shadow and lie.

Alone, Raavani traced the cracked frame of her late mothers’s portrait. Her fingers lingered on the painted eyes—cold, watchful, unyielding.

“You taught me to survive,” she whispered, voice soft but fierce. “Now I must teach them.”

The weight of the crown pressed heavy on her shoulders, but her resolve was iron. The past was a ghost, but the future was hers to command.


## The Spider's Web

In the Raavani fortress, shadows clung to the walls like cobwebs. Raavani’s throne groaned as she leaned forward. 

Her voice, like Surpanakha’s, was a blade wrapped in silk.

“Ayodhya’s lamps burn bright,” she said. “We cast the shadow. Ram sits on his lotus. He does not see the rot. Their coffers swell. Their roots crack.”

Kumbhini's laugh shattered the silence. She twirled a dagger between her fingers. “Bharath thinks he can touch what he wants.” She pulled at her blouse. Her skin was smooth. The lie was clean.

Tadaka’s eyes were hard. “He thought us weak. Even a golden deer can gore the hunter.”

Kaikesi's fists clenched. She remembered her husband's last moments—the way his hands had clawed at his chest, as if trying to rip out the anger he'd swallowed for years.

Raavani rose. Her shadow swallowed them all. "Your husband died begging for a son. Will you die begging for mercy?"

The dagger slipped from Kumbhini’s hand. It hit the stone. Kaikesi’s knees followed. The sound echoed in the cold room.


## Berries and Blades

Back in Ayodhya, Ram found Surpanakha crushing blackberries between her fingers. The dark juice seeped down her wrists, staining her skin like old blood—an echo of the queen’s handkerchief, pressed tight in memory. The scent was sharp, sour, like secrets rotting beneath the surface.

Luv’s sword struck the bush. A thorn tore his palm. He didn’t flinch.

“Raavani moves against us,” Ram said, voice low.

Surpanakha licked the juice from her fingers, slow and deliberate. “Walls keep secrets.”

Ram’s calloused hand caught her wrist. Her pulse fluttered beneath his grip, quick and uneven. “She claims Bharath assaulted her daughters.”

“Poor girls,” Surpanakha said, voice soft but edged with something darker. “Though Kumbhini did always enjoy... performances.”


## Midnight Shadows

Later, beneath the cold moonlight, Lakshman and Bharath stood in the quiet courtyard. The night air was thick with unspoken fears.

“Ram is too soft,” Lakshman said, voice barely above a whisper. “He sees the world through a veil of mercy. That will be our undoing.”

Bharath’s eyes narrowed. “Softness is not weakness. It is the weight of a crown that bends a man, not breaks him.”

Lakshman shook his head. “A king must be steel. Not a man who lets poison fester in his house.”

Bharath’s gaze flicked toward the palace windows, where shadows moved like ghosts. “And yet, if he breaks, what will become of us all?”

The silence stretched between them, heavy as the night.

# Chapter 3: The Heart's Reckoning

## The Gathering of Allies

In the great hall of a distant province, Surpanakha stood before a gathering of nobles and courtiers. Her smile was a blade wrapped in silk, her voice steady and sure.

“Ram showed me kindness when his own blood turned away,” she told them, eyes scanning the crowd. “Bharath’s coldness, Lakshman’s suspicion, Shanta’s silence—these fractures weaken Ayodhya.”

A murmur of agreement rippled through the assembled faces, some nodding, others exchanging wary glances.

“A kingdom divided cannot stand,” Surpanakha continued. “We offer a new path—strength through unity under Raavani’s line.”

She paused, letting the weight of her words settle. Eyes flickered with hope, fear, and ambition. The seeds of rebellion were sown.

## Whispers in the Halls

Ram heard the whispers before he saw the faces. Courtiers turned away, eyes clouded with doubt. Surpanakha’s stories were poison, seeping into every corner.

Kind to her? Ram thought bitterly. Estranged from Bharath and Lakshman? The truth is darker.

## Midnight Confidant

In the servants’ quarters, old Hanuman moved like a shadow. His hands, worn and steady, folded a threadbare cloth. He had seen the house rise and fall, the slow rot beneath the gilded walls.

He did not serve the crown alone. He served the man beneath it. Ram. The kindness in Ram’s eyes, the quiet strength beneath the weight of the crown, had never gone unnoticed.

Hanuman whispered to himself, barely more than breath, “The house may rot, but the heart still beats true.”

That night, as whispers curled like smoke through the halls, Hanuman slipped a folded note beneath Ram’s door. A small act of faith in a world unraveling.

## The Night Cough

Ram woke choking. The cloth came away dark. Not like Kausalya’s bright stains—this was the brown of a neglected blade.

Outside, steel rang. Luv trained past midnight. Each strike fell between his father’s coughs.

Surpanakha entered without sound. She held a cup of neem tea—the same bitter brew Kausalya once served her.

"Sleep," she said. Her eyes stayed on the rag.

Ram wiped his mouth. "Dead men sleep."

She left. The room kept the iron smell. His father’s sheets had reeked the same.

## The Neem Tree

Alone beneath the tree, Ram pressed his palm to the bark. The ridges matched the lines on his palm. Somewhere, Luv practiced with a steel blade now. The clang of metal carried further than wood ever had.

Ram's fingers dug into his ribs.

The house was full. He was alone.



## The Great Hall

Torches spat in the courtyard. Raavani’s envoys bowed. The leader’s gold tooth flashed. 

“Bharath’s crimes demand blood,” he said.

Ram stood still. “I know Kumbhini. I know Bharath. I know what she wants, and what he stands for.”

The envoy’s smile died. “You call our princess a whore?”

Ram’s jaw set. “I call a fig a fig.” His hand pressed his chest. The pain was sharp, new.

Oil lamps guttered. Shadows crawled the walls. Ram gripped the pillar. The carvings bit his palm.

Raavani leaned forward. Her throne was dull, her breath sour. “Truth is what survives,” she said. Her gold collar choked her neck.

Ram’s ribs ached. “Lies make poor foundations.”

Kumbhini toyed with her hairpin. The point glinted. “Says the man whose house is falling.”

Surpanakha’s eyes flicked to Kausalya’s portrait—the artist had captured the vein bulging at her temple, a frozen echo of worry long passed. "Your son spits at your brother's shadow," she said. "Your wife laughs behind her hand. . What truth do you have left?"

The garland over Ram’s head dropped petals. One clung to his neck. His vision blurred. The weight pressed down. Petals fell, silent and cold.

He had tried to be king, son, brother, husband. Now, he was none of them.


## The Collapse

Raavani’s smile was thin. “Hearts break quietly,” she said. She touched her chest. There was no pulse. “Your father’s did. Your mother’s did.”

Ram’s vision narrowed. The pillar groaned under his hand. Luv’s laughter rang out, bright and far. The boy’s sword flashed, sharp as Surpanakha’s tongue. Kausalya’s cool hand pressed his brow. Lakshman’s face flickered in the shadows—stern, hurt, his warning unspoken but heavy. Shadows flickered at the edge of his mind.

"Still you stand," Kumbhini mocked. "Like a tree refusing to—"

Ram’s knees buckled. The garland snapped. Marigold petals fell, slow and bright, catching in Raavani’s hair. 

Surpanakha’s wail came late. Her fingers brushed her lips—a reflex, not grief. She did not cry.

Raavani plucked a petal from her sleeve. She crushed it, staining her skin orange.

A breath, fragile and fading, escaped Ram’s lips.“I chose wrong.”
