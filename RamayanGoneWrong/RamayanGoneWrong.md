# Ramayan, Gone Wrong

*A Novella*  


# Chapter 1: The Unlikely Union

## The Courtyard

Dust hung thick in the air, settling on cracked stone and faded marigolds. Ram sat beneath the neem tree, its roots twisting like old scars through the earth. Luv swung a wooden sword, striking at shadows that fled before him.

Surpanakha’s footsteps were soft but certain as she approached, carrying a small basket wrapped in cloth. Ram looked up, hope flickering in his eyes.

He held out a pomegranate, its red seeds gleaming like scattered rubies. “Even thorns bear fruit,” he said gently.

She took the fruit but did not break it open. Her fingers curled around it, cold and still. “Thorns protect their fruit,” she said, voice low and smooth. “Men pluck it without care.”

Ram’s gaze softened as he watched Luv swing his sword at the fading light. “He has your fire,” Ram said.

Surpanakha turned away, her smile thin. “And your family’s tongue. Bharath told him kings don’t play with toys.”

Ram’s chest tightened. Bharath had given the sword himself, a gift meant to bind the boy to his uncles. But Surpanakha’s words planted a seed of doubt, a shadow between Ram and his brothers.

## The Jewelry Chest

Kausalya’s fingers trembled as she lifted the heavy lid of the ancient chest. Inside, generations of queens’ gold lay tarnished but proud—necklaces, bangles, earrings, each piece a story.

Surpanakha’s eyes flickered to a ruby choker, its stones catching the lamplight like drops of blood.

“You honor me too much,” Surpanakha said softly.

Kausalya clasped the choker around her neck. The metal pressed warm against her skin. “This house is yours now.”

Surpanakha smiled, but it did not reach her eyes. She traced the ruby’s edge. A mother’s love is easy to fool, she thought.

Kausalya’s breath hitched. She pressed a bracelet into Surpanakha’s palm. “For Luv’s bride.”

Surpanakha’s thumb brushed the cold metal. A pawn’s ransom, she thought.

## The Empty Moral: Raavani household

Far from Ayodhya, in the shadowed halls, Raavani sat like a queen on a throne of silence. Kaikesi, her eldest, stood nearby, her face pale and drawn. The portrait of her late husband hung crooked on the wall, a silent witness to a life ended too soon. His heart had failed him, crushed beneath the weight of Raavani's schemes. 

Her younger daughters, Kumbhini and Tadaka, moved around her like restless shadows, their eyes sharp and calculating.

Raavani’s voice was low but firm. “This house is your first love,” she said, her fingers tightening on the armrest. “No man will claim you while I breathe.” "My daughter Supranakha has fotgotten us"

Kumbhini smiled, but it did not reach her eyes. “They say Ayodhya is weak. That Ram is soft.”

Kaikesi’s gaze sharpened. “Softness is a lie. Strength is control.”

The daughters exchanged glances, their unspoken plans weaving like threads in the dark.

## The River

Back in Ayodhya,The river choked on monsoon mud. Lakshman's bowstring creaked as he drew it taut. "She's turning Luv against us."

Ram scrubbed his hands in the current. The silt stung his nails. "Time heals."

"Not poison." Lakshman loosed the arrow. It vanished in the swirling water. "You're too trusting."

Ram watched the river swallow the shaft. "And you not enough."

## The Empty House

The evening meal was quiet. Kausalya sat apart, her eyes distant, watching Surpanakha with a mixture of hope and suspicion. Bharath and Lakshman exchanged glances over their plates, their silence louder than any words. Shanta, ever the observer, traced patterns in the rice with her fingers, her face unreadable.

Later, in the dim light of the inner chamber, Surpanakha spoke softly to Ram. “Your mother wonders if you have lost your way. She says you are blind to the truth.”

Ram’s hands rested on his knees, steady but tired. “Truth is not always loud,” he said. “Sometimes it is a whisper beneath the noise.”

She leaned closer, her breath a faint scent of jasmine and something sharper. “Your brothers think you weak. Lakshman warned you, but you would not listen.”

Ram’s eyes met hers, searching. “I listen to my heart.”

Behind the closed door, the palace murmured with secrets. Whispers of doubt, scandal, a king who had chosen the wrong bride.



## The Web of Lies

Ram’s isolation grew. Surpanakha’s stories spread like wildfire, painting him as indulgent, blind, and weak, creating stories of the rift among brothers. Kausalya’s visits grew less frequent, Bharath’s greetings colder, Lakshman’s warnings sharper.

One evening, Surpanakha whispered to Luv as he lay in bed, “Your uncles think you weak. They do not see your fire.”

The boy’s grip tightened on his wooden sword, his small face set with fierce determination.

Ram watched from the doorway, his heart heavy. The house was full, but he was alone.

## The Coughing

Blood stained Kausalya’s handkerchief—dark, like crushed hibiscus petals pressed between old pages. Her breath came ragged, each cough a slow unraveling, as if the cells inside her were turning to dust, breaking down quietly, unseen.

She sat by the window, pale light falling on her skin that seemed thinner each day, as if the sickness was eating her from the inside out. Ram watched, helpless, feeling the weight of something breaking in the air between them.

Her fingers found his cheek, cold and trembling. Her eyes held a quiet sorrow, deep and endless. She whispered, voice cracked like dry earth,“You walk a blade’s edge—between the duty to your wife, the duty to your blood, and the duty to justice itself. Hold fast to one, and the others will burn you alive.”

Ram’s heart clenched. Somewhere inside, a part of him was rotting too—his old ideals, the sharp edges of his conscience dulling like forgotten bones buried beneath the soil. He wanted to fight, to hold on, but the decay was slow and patient, creeping through his spirit like a shadow.

By dusk, the servants whispered in hushed tones. The queen’s sickness was no secret now. It was a slow rot, a shadow growing in the house—and in Ram’s heart.

# Chapter 2: The Fractured Bonds

## Scene 1: The Gift

Bharath placed the dagger on the table. Pearl handle, like Ram’s crown.

"For your tenth year," Bharath said.

Luv looked at his mother.

Surpanakha smiled. "How thoughtful."

Ram exhaled. Shoulders easing. Maybe time could mend this.

Later, under the neem tree, she buried it.

"Gifts are debts," she told Luv. "He’ll collect."

Ram saw the turned earth at dawn. Touched it. Walked away.

By dusk, Luv carried a different knife —one Surpanakha'sister had given him. Its edge was sharper than a boy needed.

But beneath the surface, other fires burned.

## Scene 2: The Web of Rumors

In the dim light of Raavani’s chamber, Surpanakha sat with Kumbhini and Tadaka. The air was thick with the scent of crushed berries and whispered schemes.

Surpanakha crushed a blackberry between her fingers. The juice seeped into her skin like old blood, dark and staining. “The court believes in shadows,” she said, voice low and sharp. “Let them believe Ram’s heart belongs to us now”

Kumbhini’s eyes gleamed in the flickering candlelight. “That he found solace only with us. That Bharath’s loyalty is brittle, Lakshman’s pride fragile, and Shanta’s silence a wound waiting to bleed.”

Tadaka smiled, cold and cruel. “The kingdom will believe what they want to hear. A fractured family is easier to break.”

Surpanakha leaned forward, her voice a whisper but heavy with promise. “We must feed the fire carefully. The more they believe the lie, the easier it will be to claim what is ours.”

The three women exchanged glances, their unspoken plans weaving like threads in the dark.

The past was never far. It lingered in shadows, shaping the present with silent hands.


## Scene 3: Shadows of the Past

The firelight flickered against cold stone walls. A young Surpanakha sat cross-legged, eyes wide but hardening. Raavani’s voice cut through the silence, smooth and sharp as a blade.

“Win by any means,” she said, her breath a whisper of steel. “Mercy is a weakness. Power is the only truth.”

Surpanakha nodded, the lesson burning into her like a brand. The world was a battlefield, and she would learn to fight with every shadow and lie.

Alone in her chamber, Raavani traced the cracked frame of her late husband’s portrait. Her fingers lingered on the painted eyes—cold, watchful, unyielding.

“You taught me to survive,” she whispered, voice soft but fierce. “Now I must teach them.”

The weight of the crown pressed heavy on her shoulders, but her resolve was iron. The past was a ghost, but the future was hers to command.


## Scene 3: The Spider's Web

The poison spread swiftly. In the Raavani fortress, shadows clung to the walls like cobwebs. Raavani's throne creaked as she leaned forward. Her voice, like Surpanakha’s, was a blade wrapped in silk.

"Ayodhya grows fat on our neglect." Her voice was oil on water. "Ram is a fool. Their coffers overflow."

Raavani stood motionless. The portrait of her dead husband watched from the wall—his eyes widened by the painter per her request.

"They've done no harm," she said.

Kumbhini's laugh shattered the silence. She twirled a dagger between her fingers. "Harm? Shall I show you where Bharath touched me?" Her free hand tugged at her neckline, revealing unblemished skin.

Tadaka stepped forward, her face a mask of fury. "He thought us weak. Thought we'd never dare—"

Kaikesi's fists clenched. She remembered her husband's last moments—the way his hands had clawed at his chest, as if trying to rip out the anger he'd swallowed for years.

Raavani rose. Her shadow swallowed them all. "Your husband died begging for a son. Will you die begging for mercy?"

The dagger clattered to the floor. Kaikesi's knees followed.

## Scene 4: Berries and Blades

Ram found Surpanakha crushing blackberries between her fingers. The dark juice seeped down her wrists, staining her skin like old blood—an echo of the queen’s handkerchief, pressed tight in memory. The scent was sharp, sour, like secrets rotting beneath the surface.

Luv’s sword struck the bush. A thorn tore his palm. He didn’t flinch.

“Raavani moves against us,” Ram said, voice low.

Surpanakha licked the juice from her fingers, slow and deliberate. “Walls keep secrets.”

Ram’s calloused hand caught her wrist. Her pulse fluttered beneath his grip, quick and uneven. “She claims Bharath assaulted her daughters.”

“Poor girls,” Surpanakha said, voice soft but edged with something darker. “Though Kumbhini did always enjoy... performances.”

## Scene 5: Midnight Shadows

Later, beneath the cold moonlight, Lakshman and Bharath stood in the quiet courtyard. The night air was thick with unspoken fears.

“Ram is too soft,” Lakshman said, voice barely above a whisper. “He sees the world through a veil of mercy. That will be our undoing.”

Bharath’s eyes narrowed. “Softness is not weakness. It is the weight of a crown that bends a man, not breaks him.”

Lakshman shook his head. “A king must be steel. Not a man who lets poison fester in his house.”

Bharath’s gaze flicked toward the palace windows, where shadows moved like ghosts. “And yet, if he breaks, what will become of us all?”

The silence stretched between them, heavy as the night.



---

## Scene 6: The Messengers

Torches guttered in the courtyard as Raavani's envoys bowed. Their leader's smile didn't reach his eyes.

"Bharath's crimes demand blood," she said. The gold in his teeth caught the light.

Ram's voice cut through the night. "I know Kumbhini. I know Bharath. I know what she dances for, and what Bharath stands for."

The smile vanished. "You call our princess a whore?"

Ram’s jaw tightened. He did not blink. “I call a fig a fig.” Ram's hand went to his chest. The pain was new—sharp as Kaikesi's gaze burning into his back.



# Chapter 3: The Heart's Reckoning

## The Gathering of Allies

In the great hall of a distant province, Surpanakha stood before a gathering of nobles and courtiers. Her smile was a blade wrapped in silk, her voice steady and sure.

“Ram showed me kindness when his own blood turned away,” she told them, eyes scanning the crowd. “Bharath’s coldness, Lakshman’s suspicion, Shanta’s silence—these fractures weaken Ayodhya.”

A murmur of agreement rippled through the assembled faces, some nodding, others exchanging wary glances.

“A kingdom divided cannot stand,” Surpanakha continued. “We offer a new path—strength through unity under Raavani’s line.”

She paused, letting the weight of her words settle. Eyes flickered with hope, fear, and ambition. The seeds of rebellion were sown.

## Midnight Confidant

In the servants’ quarters, old Hanuman moved like a shadow. His hands, worn and steady, folded a threadbare cloth. He had seen the house rise and fall, the slow rot beneath the gilded walls.

He did not serve the crown alone. He served the man beneath it. Ram. The kindness in Ram’s eyes, the quiet strength beneath the weight of the crown, had never gone unnoticed.

Hanuman whispered to himself, barely more than breath, “The house may rot, but the heart still beats true.”

That night, as whispers curled like smoke through the halls, Hanuman slipped a folded note beneath Ram’s door. A small act of faith in a world unraveling.

## Whispers in the Halls

Ram heard the whispers before he saw the faces. Courtiers turned away, eyes clouded with doubt. Surpanakha’s stories were poison, seeping into every corner.

Kind to her? Ram thought bitterly. Estranged from Bharath and Lakshman? The truth is darker.

## The Great Hall

The oil lamps guttered. Shadows licked the walls like tongues. Ram's knuckles whitened against the pillar. The carvings bit into his palm—lotuses swallowing their own stems.

Raavani's throne gleamed dull as an old knife. She leaned forward, her breath sour with betel nut. "Truth is what survives," she said. Her gold collar pressed into her neck like a noose.

Ram's ribs creaked. The pain was a living thing now, curled behind his breastbone. "Lies make poor foundations."

Kumbhini toyed with her hairpin. The point glinted. "Says the man whose house crumbles."

Surpanakha’s eyes flicked to Kausalya’s portrait—the artist had captured the vein bulging at her temple, a frozen echo of worry long passed. "Your son spits at your brother's shadow," she said. "Your wife laughs behind her hand. What truth sustains you?"

The garland over Ram's head shed petals. One stuck to his sweat-slick neck. Ram’s vision blurred at the edges, the weight of the garland heavy on his neck, petals falling like silent accusations

## The Night Cough

Ram woke choking. The cloth came away dark. Not like Kausalya’s bright stains—this was the brown of a neglected blade.

Outside, steel rang. Luv trained past midnight. Each strike fell between his father’s coughs.

Surpanakha entered without sound. She held a cup of neem tea—the same bitter brew Kausalya once served her.

"Sleep," she said. Her eyes stayed on the rag.

Ram wiped his mouth. "Dead men sleep."

She left. The room kept the iron smell. His father’s sheets had reeked the same.

---

## The Neem Tree

Alone beneath the tree, Ram pressed his palm to the bark. The ridges matched the lines on his palm. Somewhere, Luv practiced with a steel blade now. The clang of metal carried further than wood ever had.

Ram's fingers dug into his ribs. The house was full. He was alone.


## The Collapse

Raavani's smile widened. "Hearts break quietly." She touched her own chest, where no pulse showed. "Your father's did. Your mother's did."

Ram’s vision darkened at the edges. The pillar groaned beneath his weight. Luv’s laughter echoed—wild and clear. The boy’s new sword gleamed as he tested its edge against his thumb, sharp as Surpanakha’s words. Kausalya’s cool hands pressed to his fevered brow. Shadows flickered at the edge of his mind—faint, distant, but never gone.

"Still you stand," Kumbhini mocked. "Like a tree refusing to—"

Ram fell. The garland snapped. Marigold petals snowed down, catching in Raavani's hair like fireflies.

Surpanakha’s wail came late. Her fingers brushed her lips—a reflex, not grief. She did not weep.

Raavani plucked a petal from her sleeve. She crushed it between thumb and forefinger, staining her skin orange.

A breath, fragile and fading, escaped Ram’s lips.“I chose wrong.”
